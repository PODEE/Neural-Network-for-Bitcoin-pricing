Predictive models  for Bitcoin end of day closing price
The Google Colab notebook attached takes a detailed delve in building models in multiple linear regression and logistic regression. There's a further delve into a Deep Learning (a Neural Network that attempts to predict if the Closing Day price of Bitcoin will exceed the Opening price. This model can be improved further by pulling even more data from Yahoo finance. I will update these models from time to time to improve the general accuracy. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
